# vr_mailer_list_generator

This is a scrappy sample project meant to build out two primary tools:
1. Maintain a database in BigQuery that tracks a person / voter file list, and regularly updates it with new NCOA data queried via API.
2. A tool that allows a non-technical user to build basic queries of people in the person / voter file database and submit and track requests to generate lists of mailer addresses for these people.
